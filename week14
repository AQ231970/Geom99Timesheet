finished working on the solution on experience builder. It's kind of unfinished and has very simple sample/test data in it. I attempted to add in the web map that I created using the results of mengjie's 
so, note to self: next time make maybe a duplicate of the survey yourself, and use the map made through that. There were loads of issues trying to get the values from the web map created (and creating the web map itself from the layers and features from mengjie's survey123 results.)
it would've been better to have just made my own content perhaps. Still not 100% sure. 

LOTS of trial and error trying to get those maps from mengjie's survey to show. ended up using my own simpler data for addresses to at least create some form of how the experience builder functionality might work, had her data more smoothly and errorlessly been added.

Rest of the time was spent working on our final website, the html, css and some javascript. Compiled all our work and insights.
