#Met with Shawn and team on March 15 2024 during lab. 
**The following is a short list of recommendations from Shawn**
ARCGIS SOLUTIONS -> Get a data model from here
Check to see if a potential hidden address already exists (in a database) - use york region data
- I looked for a bit on arcgis online solutions and found two potential solution templates/outlines:
- community data aggregation and property and address data management
- looks like there will be room for presenting the solution on here as well as incorporating the data and creating a user input solution. need to understand this more. will do today.
