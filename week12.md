**Continuing work on the arc solutions and finding ways of location-finding applications**
1. Working with proto-data and integrating it into the solution template interface.
2. First began with adding my proto data into the Community addresses feature layer's table

4. Conducted some search into methods of location finder functionalities on websites that may be used by the caller of a 911 emergency call
5. something that looks doable and interesting: geolocation API on html5: https://www.w3.org/TR/geolocation/#get-current-positionâ€”it retunrs the lat long coordinates of the user (something to consider: are lat long coordinates enough for a 911 dispatcher to find a caller?)
6. see https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geolocation/overview
7. tried to add this functionality to my own personal website and see how it works. i haven't been able to firgue out how to make the lat long return and display to the user. will continue later.
