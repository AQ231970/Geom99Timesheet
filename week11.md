**ArcGIS Solutions: Address Data Management**

1. First I went to York Region's open data page and searched for some recent address data - I settled on a businesses dataset for my first attempt at arc solutions
2. I began by downloading the arcgis pro project that comes with the solution. It has some road data, and address data
3. i added my downloaded data (yet to clean it but i want to focus on trying out the arcgis solution for now)
went back to portal to look for some road data to add - didnt realize how vital it would be for the solution, considering its for ng 911 response
